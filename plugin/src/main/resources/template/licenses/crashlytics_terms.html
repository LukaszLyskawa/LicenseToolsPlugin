Subject to and without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card information, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, dates of birth or physical addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not invite any user to be a Tester that is under the age of consent as defined under any applicable laws, rules, or regulations relating to data collection, including without limitation the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR"), and all other relevant laws and regulations. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Developer shall maintain a privacy policy: (a) that is readily accessible to users from its website or within its online service (as applicable), (b) that fully and accurately discloses to its users what information is collected about its users, and (c) that states that such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers like Google in the manner contemplated by the Services, including, without limitation, disclosure of the use of technology to track users' activity and otherwise collect information from users. In addition, when using the Firebase App Distribution Service, Developer shall maintain contact information that shall be available to its Testers to obtain any necessary information regarding the processing and handling of Tester information.

        4.3 Claims Against Google. Developer will defend Google from all third party claims, whether actual or alleged (collectively, "Google Claims"), and will indemnify Google and hold Google harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) resulting from such Google Claims that arise out of Developer's: (a) use of the Services, (b) actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights, privacy rights or publicity rights, and (c) breach of any representations and warranties set forth in the Agreement.

If Developer uses the Services in an official capacity as an employee or representative of a United States federal, state, or local government entity and is legally unable to accept this indemnification provision, then it does not apply to such entity, but only to the extent required by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p class="inline">
        4.4 Claims Against Developer. Google will defend the Developer from all third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, "Developer Claims"), and will indemnify Developer and hold Developer harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) resulting from such Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Services, when used as expressly permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Google will have no obligation under this Section 4.4 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (a) any use of the Services not expressly permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Services in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Google if such infringement would have been avoided without the combination with such other products, equipment, software, or data; (c) any modification of the Services by any person other than Google or its authorized agents or subcontractors; or (d) any claim not clearly based on the Services itself.

Neither party may make any public announcement of any claim, defense or settlement without the other party's prior written approval. The indemnifying party may not settle, compromise or resolve a claim without the consent of the indemnified party, if such settlement, compromise or resolution (i) causes or requires an admission or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (i) imposes any monetary damages against the indemnified party, or (iii) does not fully release the indemnified party from liability with respect to the claim.
      </p>
      <p class="inline">

Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in this Agreement. Subject to the confidentiality requirements in of this Agreement, either party may petition any competent court to issue any order necessary to protect that party's rights or property; this petition will not be considered a violation or waiver of this governing law and arbitration section and will not affect the arbitrator's powers, including the power to review the judicial decision. The parties stipulate that the courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, are competent to grant any order under this subsection. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property. Any arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with this section will be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement's confidentiality section, including: (i) the existence of, (ii) any information disclosed during, and (iii) any oral communications or documents related to the arbitration proceedings. The parties may also disclose the information described in this section to a competent court as may be necessary to file any order under this section or execute any arbitral decision, but the parties must request that those judicial proceedings be conducted in camera (in private). The parties will pay the arbitrator's fees, the arbitrator's appointed experts' fees and expenses, and the arbitration center's administrative expenses in accordance with the Rules. In its final decision, the arbitrator will determine the non-prevailing party's obligation to reimburse the amount paid in advance by the prevailing party for these fees. Each party will bear its own lawyers' and experts' fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator's final decision.
